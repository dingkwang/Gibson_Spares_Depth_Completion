# Gibson+Sparse-Depth-Completion

This repo first create a virtual robotics environment using [Gibson](https://github.com/StanfordVL/iGibson). RGB and spare LiDAR data are generated in the Gibson. Then I use the trained model of Sparse-Depth-Completion (https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion) to perform guided up sampling and generate a dense depth image. The training runs on [HIPERGATOR 3.0](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/services/hipergator/).

[31m-This repo contains the implementation of our paper [Sparse and Noisy LiDAR Completion with RGB Guidance and Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05356) by [Wouter Van Gansbeke](https://github.com/wvangansbeke), Davy Neven, Bert De Brabandere and Luc Van Gool.[m
[32m+[m[32mThis repo first create a virtual robotics environment using [Gibson](https://github.com/StanfordVL/iGibson). RGB and spare LiDAR data are generated in the Gibson. Then I use the trained model of Sparse-Depth-Completion (https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion) to perform guided up sampling and generate a dense depth image. The training runs on [HIPERGATOR 3.0](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/services/hipergator/).[m

[31m-## Introduction[m
[31m-Monocular depth prediction methods fail to generate absolute and precise depth maps and stereoscopic approaches are still significantly outperformed by LiDAR based approaches. The goal of the depth completion task is to generate dense depth predictions from sparse and irregular point clouds. This project makes use of uncertainty to combine multiple sensor data in order to generate accurate depth predictions. Mapped lidar points together with RGB images (monococular) are used in this framework. This method holds the **1st place** entry on the [KITTI depth completion benchmark](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_completion) at the time of submission of the paper.[m
 [m
[31m-The contribution of this paper is threefold:[m
[31m-* Global and local information are combined in order to accurately complete and correct the sparse and noisy LiDAR input. Monocular RGB images are used for the guidance of this depth completion task.[m
[31m-* Confidence maps are learned for the global branch and the local branch in an unsupervised manner. The predicted depth maps are weighted by their respective confidence map. This is the late fusion technique used in our framework.[m
[31m-* This method ranks first on the KITTI depth completion benchmark without using additional data or postprocessing.[m
[31m-[m

[31m-## Dataset[m
[31m-The [Kitti dataset](www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) has been used. First download the dataset of the depth completion. Secondly, you'll need to unzip and download the camera images from kitti. [m
[31m-I used the file `download_raw_files.sh`, but this is at your own risk. Make sure you understand it, otherwise don't use it. If you want to keep it safe, go to kitti's website. [m
[31m-[m
[31m-The complete dataset consists of 85898 training samples, 6852 validation samples, 1000 selected validation samples and 1000 test samples.[m

[31m-## Preprocessing[m
[31m-This step is optional, but allows you to transform the images to jpgs and to downsample the original lidar frames. This will create a new dataset in $dest.[m

[31m-Practical discussion:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-- I recently increased the stability of the training process and I also made the convergence faster by adding some skip connections between the global and local network.[m
[31m-Initially I only used guidance by multiplication with an attention map (=probability), but found out that it is less robust and that differences between a focal MSE and vanilla MSE loss function were now negligible.[m
[31m-Be aware that this change will alter the appearance of the confidence maps since fusion happens at mutliple stages now.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-- Feel free to experiment with different architectures for the global or local network. It is easy to add new architectures to `Models/__init__.py`[m
